    "scene_reasoning": "### **Top-Left (Left Peripheral 120\u00b0 View)**  \n**Road Characteristics & Markings**:  \n- The road is a two - way urban street with a **double yellow center line** (indicating no passing) and a **single yellow edge line** on the right.  \n- Pavement shows significant cracking and patching, particularly in the center of the road. The sidewalk runs parallel to the street, with a concrete curb separating it from the road.  \n\n**Vehicles**:  \n- **1 silver sedan** is parked along the left - hand side of the road, near a building.  \n- In the background, **2\u20133 vehicles** are visible: a dark SUV and a white vehicle parked further down the street (partially obscured by buildings).  \n- No moving vehicles are present in this view.  \n\n**People**:  \n- No pedestrians or workers are visible in the Left Peripheral view.  \n\n**Traffic Infrastructure**:  \n- A **street sign** (likely a one - way or street name sign) is mounted on a utility pole near the building on the left.  \n- **Power lines** and **utility poles** crisscross above the street, with multiple wires visible.  \n- A **chain - link fence** runs along the property line of the building on the left, separating the sidewalk from the private property.  \n\n**Weather & Lighting**:  \n- **Partly cloudy** with bright sunlight; shadows indicate it is likely mid - morning or early afternoon.  \n- The sky has scattered, fluffy white clouds, and sunlight creates clear shadows on the road.  \n\n**Construction Equipment/Activity**:  \n- No construction activity is visible in this view.  \n\n**Hazards/Unusual Elements**:  \n- The **cracked pavement** (especially in the center) poses a potential hazard for vehicles.  \n\n\n### **Top-Right (Front Wide 120\u00b0 View)**  \n**Road Characteristics & Markings**:  \n- The road is a two - way street with a **double yellow center line** and a **yellow edge line** on the right.  \n- A **white \"PFD\" marking** (likely a local traffic control or parking designation) is painted on the pavement near the center of the road.  \n\n**Vehicles**:  \n- **1 white sedan** is driving away from the camera (in the lane closest to the camera).  \n- **1 white pickup truck** is visible in the distance (further down the road, in the left lane).  \n- Parked vehicles: A **silver sedan** is visible on the left side of the road, and a dark SUV is parked further down (partially obscured by buildings).  \n\n**People**:  \n- A **worker in an orange high - visibility safety vest** is operating a small excavator on the right side of the road (construction zone).  \n\n**Traffic Infrastructure**:  \n- **Orange traffic cones** are placed to mark the construction zone.  \n- A **chain - link fence** surrounds the construction area on the right side of the road.  \n- **Streetlights** and **power lines** are visible, consistent with an urban setting.  \n\n**Weather & Lighting**:  \n- Same as Top - Left: **partly cloudy** with bright sunlight and clear shadows.  \n\n**Construction Equipment/Activity**:  \n- A **yellow Caterpillar excavator** (small, compact model) is actively working on the road\u2019s right side.  \n- **Concrete rubble** is piled near the excavator, indicating ongoing roadwork.  \n- The construction zone is enclosed by a **chain - link fence**, with orange traffic cones placed to direct traffic.  \n\n**Hazards/Unusual Elements**:  \n- The **construction zone** is a major hazard due to the excavator, rubble, and restricted traffic flow.  \n- The **\"PFD\" marking** is unusual and may not be standard; it could indicate a specialized traffic regulation.  \n\n\n### **Bottom-Left (Right Peripheral 120\u00b0 View)**  \n**Road Characteristics & Markings**:  \n- The road is a two - way street, with the right side showing a **yellow edge line** and smooth pavement (less cracking than the Left Peripheral view).  \n- A **sidewalk** runs parallel to the road, with a concrete curb separating it from the street.  \n\n**Vehicles**:  \n- **1 white pickup truck** with a roof rack is parked on the right - hand side of the road.  \n- In the background, **1 white vehicle** (possibly a van or SUV) is parked further down the street.  \n\n**People**:  \n- A **worker in an orange high - visibility safety vest** stands near the excavator (in the construction zone).  \n- A **cyclist** is visible riding on the road (left side of the image) in the background.  \n\n**Traffic Infrastructure**:  \n- **Orange traffic cones** are placed to mark the construction zone boundary.  \n- A **yellow \"Pedestrian Crossing\" sign** is mounted on a pole on the right - hand side of the road.  \n- A **chain - link fence** encloses the construction area, which appears to be on the sidewalk or road shoulder.  \n\n**Weather & Lighting**:  \n- **Partly cloudy** with bright sunlight, identical to the other views.  \n\n**Construction Equipment/Activity**:  \n- The same **yellow Caterpillar excavator** from the Top - Right view is visible, with its bucket raised and **concrete rubble** piled on the ground.  \n- The excavator is positioned on what appears to be a **sidewalk or road shoulder**, working on the edge of the road.  \n\n**Hazards/Unusual Elements**:  \n- The **construction zone** is hazardous due to the excavator\u2019s operation and rubble.  \n- The **cyclist** on the road near the construction zone poses a safety risk.  \n\n\n### **Bottom-Right (Front Telephoto 30\u00b0 View)**  \n**Road Characteristics & Markings**:  \n- The road is a two - way street with a **single yellow edge line** on the right.  \n- Pavement is smooth and well - maintained, with no visible cracks.  \n\n**Vehicles**:  \n- **1 white sedan** is directly ahead of the vehicle (in the same lane as the camera\u2019s perspective).  \n- In the background:  \n  - **1 black SUV** driving in the opposite direction.  \n  - **1 white pickup truck** parked on the right - hand side of the road.  \n  - **2\u20133 additional vehicles** are visible in the distance (partially obscured by buildings).  \n\n**People**:  \n- A **cyclist** is riding on the right - hand side of the road (to the right of the white sedan).  \n- A **pedestrian** is visible near commercial buildings on the right (in the background).  \n\n**Traffic Infrastructure**:  \n- A **yellow \"Pedestrian Crossing\" sign** is mounted on a pole on the right - hand side of the road.  \n- A large **billboard** advertises \"El Estan\" (likely a local business), with text and images visible.  \n- **Street signs** indicate \"1st St\" and other directional markers.  \n\n**Weather & Lighting**:  \n- **Partly cloudy** with bright sunlight, consistent with the other views.  \n\n**Construction Equipment/Activity**:  \n- No construction activity is visible in this telephoto view (the area is more commercial/urban).  \n\n**Hazards/Unusual Elements**:  \n- The **cyclist** on the road poses a potential collision risk.  \n- The **\"El Estan\" billboard** is a unique visual element, but not a hazard.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Elements Across All Views**  \n- **Construction Zone**: A small yellow excavator is active on the right - hand side of the road (Top - Right and Bottom - Left views), working near concrete rubble and enclosed by a chain - link fence. Workers in orange safety vests are present.  \n- **Vehicles**: Multiple cars (sedans, pickup trucks, SUVs) are visible in all views, with some parked and some moving.  \n- **People**: Workers at the construction site, a cyclist, and a pedestrian are present.  \n- **Road Conditions**: Mixed pavement quality (cracks in some areas, smooth in others).  \n- **Traffic Infrastructure**: Yellow edge lines, center lines, traffic cones, \"Pedestrian Crossing\" signs, and a large billboard.  \n- **Weather**: Consistently **partly cloudy** with bright sunlight across all four camera views.  \n- **Hazards**: Construction zone (excavator, rubble), cracked pavement, and the cyclist on the road.  \n\nThis comprehensive breakdown ensures all elements are documented for accurate downstream classification (e.g., object detection, hazard assessment, traffic pattern analysis).",

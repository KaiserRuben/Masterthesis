    "full_description": "The autonomous vehicle's 4-camera grid captures a multi-faceted urban street scene with an active construction zone. Top-left: A silver sedan is parked along the left curb of a cracked asphalt road with yellow center lines. Background includes residential buildings (pink multi-story structure, white house, gray apartment), utility poles with power lines, and trees under a partly cloudy sky. Top-right: From the vehicle\u2019s windshield, a white sedan drives ahead in the same lane on a road marked \"PFD\". Right side shows active construction: an excavator (operator in orange vest) near piles of broken concrete/debris, flanked by orange traffic cones. Multiple vehicles are visible further down the road. Bottom-left: Close-up of construction zone with excavator (operator visible), another worker in orange vest near it, orange traffic cones, and construction fencing enclosing the work area; trees and buildings are visible beyond the fence. Bottom-right: Vehicle\u2019s right-side view shows a white Toyota sedan ahead, a white pickup truck with a \"133\" sign on the rear, a black SUV, and a delivery truck parked on the right. A cyclist is visible near the white Toyota, with a yellow pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road. Commercial signage (\"El Est\u00e1ndar de Oro\" billboard), traffic lights, and utility poles are present under a partly cloudy sky.",
